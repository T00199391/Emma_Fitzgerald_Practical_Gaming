The main goal of the game is to defeat all the enemies in an area to capture the keep
There will be a time limit depending on what level you are currently playing
The less time you have the harder the enemies will be to defeat
The when all the enemies are defeated then there will be a main enemy you must defeat to capute the keep
Level one will be like a tutorial
It will introduce you to the main game play tasks of the game
The first level will consist of one area you must take over
The enemies will be easy to defeat and the mini boss will be after all the smaller enemies are defeated
The second level will have two areas you must capture
You must complete the first area before you can capture the second area
Again there will be a mini boss in both areas
In the third area you will have to defeat enemies that are like mini bosses to enter the area you must capture
Once you defeat them then you will be able to continue to captuing the area
The forth area will bea mix of area 2 and 3 just the enemies are harder
The fifth and final area will be like area 4 but will have a big boss after you capture the two areas
once you beat the boss the game will finish
